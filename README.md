# FaceTech: Advanced Facial Recognition & Voice Assistant Web Application

Welcome to **FaceTech**! This project was initially developed as part of my assignment for the CPE593 course during my final year in Computer Engineering. However, it's now open source for anyone to explore, use, and build upon. The website combines cutting-edge facial recognition technology with a robust voice assistant, creating a seamless, interactive user experience.

## Features
- **Real-Time Facial Recognition**: Utilize face-api.js to detect faces, landmarks, expressions, and even estimate age and gender.
- **Voice Commands Integration**: Control the application with simple voice commands using Web Speech API.
- **Responsive UI**: The interface is designed for optimal performance across devices, with a sleek and intuitive design.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend and adapt the features to suit your needs.

## Project Overview
This project includes:
1. A facial recognition system powered by face-api.js, integrated into a web-based interface.
2. Voice command functionality that allows users to interact with the application using spoken commands.
3. A comprehensive form pack including sign-up, login, and contact forms, powered by the **Tooplate 2136 Kool Form Pack**.

## Getting Started

## Acknowledgments
- A special shoutout to the creators of the **[Tooplate 2136 Kool Form Pack](https://www.tooplate.com/view/2136-kool-form-pack)**, which provided the stylish and functional forms featured in this project. Their Bootstrap 5 Form Pack Template made the implementation of sign-up, login, and contact forms a breeze.
- Additionally, I'd like to thank **[KNOWLEDGE DOCTOR](https://www.youtube.com/@knowledgedoctor3849)** for their amazing tutorial on real-time face landmark detection, expression recognition, and age & gender estimation using JavaScript. You can also check out his [GitHub](https://github.com/Chando0185). His tutorial played a crucial role in developing the facial recognition feature in this project.
- A special thanks to **[Devistry](https://www.youtube.com/c/Devistry)** for teaching me about voice synthesis through his video on ðŸ¤– **Build a Javascript Chatbot with speech recognition, and voice synthesis API ðŸŽ¤ðŸ”Š**. His insights were invaluable for implementing voice commands in this project.
